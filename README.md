# ThreeJS-Boilerplate
A template for getting started with three.js using jquery and RequireJS

## Overview
When I was getting started with three.js I found it pretty difficult to find a structured working example containing all the parts needed to get going. This is an attempt to build something for people looking for a place to start.

The main components for creating a scene are in /app/modules/stage/ and can be extended as required.

If any of this is confusing or wrong please feel free to let me know. I am in no way an expert :)
